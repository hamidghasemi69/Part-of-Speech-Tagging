Implementation of Hidden Markov Model for part of speech tagging 

# Project Overview: Implementing HMM for part of speech tagging
In this notebook, I used the Pomegranate library to build a hidden Markov model (HMM) for part-of-speech tagging with a universal tagset. Hidden Markov models have achieved over 96% tag accuracy with larger tagsets on realistic text corpora. Beyond part-of-speech tagging, HMMs have been applied in various fields, including speech recognition and generation, machine translation, gene recognition in bioinformatics, human gesture recognition for computer vision, and more.
